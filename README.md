# AWS - DevOps on AWS Specialization

These are the notes for myself taken from the specialization ["DevOps On AWS"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aws-devops). I have switched from using One Note for any of my note taking to Juypyter notebooks, hosted on Google Colab, mainly because I realized it was a better format for taking technical notes. I could use code block examples and automatically run turning the notes into a better form of active rather than passive learning. I've also found that it is much easier doing the formatting I want using Markdown than the autoformating that Microsoft Office products use, which continues to be a mystery to me. Because most of the code was given in the form of handouts, I mainly do no have code on the notebooks themselves, except for clairification of something that cannot run on Jupyter anyway.

My thoughts for that class is that it was solid, relating to general concepts of DevOps before going into the specific way these concepts could be implemented on AWS. The first class, which was a general walkthrough of AWS applications was something I had already taken, and received credit for.

In these notes, I tried to draw from my own personal and professional experiences to relate to the subject.

The specialization is estimated to take about 10 hours to learn, and Coursera breaks it up into three four week chunks, not counting the introduction to AWS, which I had already taken.

I have made some personal anotations for myself through the comments feature of Google Colab, which I do not believe will transfer through into github. In general hope to use this as a study guide, and I've encouraged friends and family members to also take the class, and hopefully form study groups so we can all work together to better understand the subject and incorporate it into our lives. Others are welcome to use these notes as they see fit.
